OSSU BSc Computer Science

This repository tracks my journey through the OSSU Computer Science program, an open-source curriculum offering a university-level computer science education. 

This repository serves as both a personal learning archive and a showcase of my dedication to mastering computer science.

Every "Lecture" folder has 2 sub-folders:

1. Notes - Digital notes I take while studying.

2. Problem Sets - Includes the PSET Materials folder (lecture overview/PSET instructions if it is the case) and PSET code files.
