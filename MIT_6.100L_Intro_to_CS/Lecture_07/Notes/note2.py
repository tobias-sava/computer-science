def is_even(i): # declaring function, function name, function params (separated by commas if multiple)
  '''
  Clear function description so other people can know the purpose of your code.
  '''
  if i % 2 == 0: # if i divded by 2's remainder is 0 the number is even
    return True
  else:
    return False
  
# Instead of using if statements, we can simply express the equation as it already provides us with
# a boolean value.

# Instead of:

  if i % 2 == 0: # if i divded by 2's remainder is 0 the number is even
    return True
  else:
    return False
  
# 

  return i % 2 == 0

# Will still return True/False based on even/odd.

# I am already familiar with functions so I will not explain calling functions but I will leave
# an example below of the function above being called.

is_even(3) # function name, paramter/s (containing needed data, in this case an int)
