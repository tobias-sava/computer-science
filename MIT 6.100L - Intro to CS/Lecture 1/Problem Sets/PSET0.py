# 1. At the top of your file and type: import numpy
# 2. Now write a line that sets a variable named x to 5.
# 3. Now write a line that sets a variable named y to 8.
# 4. Add variables x and y, and save the result to a variable named z.
# 5. Now save the result of this command: numpy.log2(z) to a variable named a.

import numpy

x = 5
y = 8

z = x + y

a = numpy.log2(z)

# Resolvation has been self-check and is correct.
