# Assume you are given an integer 0 \<= N \\<= 1000. 
# Write a piece of Python code that uses bisection search to guess N. 
# The code prints two lines: count: with how many guesses it took to find N, 
# and answer: with the value of N. Hints: If the halfway value is exactly in between two integers, 
# choose the smaller one.
